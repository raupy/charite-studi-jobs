```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, code = readLines("R/charite-jobs-scraping.R"), echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
```

Use this R script to search the job board of the [Charité](https://www.charite.de/karriere/stellenboerse/), e.g. for students by setting `r search_string <- "STUD"`.
The search results are collected in a tibble with the assigned institute, publication date and application deadline as well as the link to the respective job posting.

```{r}
url <- "https://www.charite.de/karriere/stellenboerse/"
search_string <- "STUD"
urls <- get_sites_to_crawl(url)
charite_jobs <- get_all_jobs(urls, search_string)
charite_jobs
```

If the search string is not provided, all jobs vacant at the Charité are gathered, which are currently almost 200. 

```{r}
get_all_jobs(urls) %>%
  nrow()
```
